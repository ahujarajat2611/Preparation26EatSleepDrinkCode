S2:- Mathematcical
Google outsourced it
Use it in production :- Uber, Foursquare

Hard to find :- How it does work !!

How we define :- (Spatial Indexing) :- How it is constructed
Take shpere and put cube around it and any point on spehere would have
correspoonding point on cube

ANY POINT OF SPEHERE WILL POINT ON CUBE (KEEP TRACING OUT)


HOW TO MAKE REGULAR GRID ON SPEHRE

:----- pixel on cube (projecct back on cube)
close to diagonal of box close to equator

S2cell is one of pixels :-
Sphere :- projjt :- 6 pixels of cube
quadd tree kind of construction sub divide each side of cube into 4 and subdivide
each of thsoe into 4 and make a tree structure

Then clever way of index this tree and use it

indexing using 64 bit unsigned integer (fast to use )

first three bit identify the cube size (0 to 5 ) 3 bit to do that

one of those sides divide into 4 ( 4 new pixels andd need 2 bit to represent that)
subdivide again u need 2 bits and keep doing that until you run out 64 bit int

that level is 30

spent 3 of them in the begininning and then 2 2 2 2--upto 30 level
u end up using 63 bits then last bit 1 control bit (1)



64 bit gets used

which order 0 1 2 3

Now S2 covering of polygons and then build index map of those coverinsg at
particular level

Using 64 bit u get more and more precise loctaion
u stop somewhere when you are down to meter precision
(in geo service we thot of keeping it around 1/2 km precision )

level 0 each cell contains 85 million sq kms
level 1 each cell covers 1/4 of that
level 30 each cell covers one halff and 1 ssq cm area
(level 30 less than a cm square)
64 bit int can index every cm suqre on earth

(Use a spartial indexing )

:- Make database and put indexing into database
take world cities map and
43k cities and just record unique identifier
and make hashtable where key is unieue identifier at all level
and value indices identifier of cities

covering any geomertic shape on earth on ur shpere
cover these with s2 cells runs though that shape and find resaonal fast covering
of levels


A circle .. covered by cells

We can also use complex polygons (Australia )
