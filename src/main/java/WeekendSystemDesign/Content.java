================================================== ================
in an interview to talk about how to prepare this
first if you can not even availability / scalability / consistency / partition and the like are not too shall
read it, I recommend to go wikipedia a university or find a website talking about this course a little look, not a
point is not aware of
this link is also good
http://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html

If you still have these basic things know, then I think you and most people have no practical experience of almost a
horizontal ...
can do is to prepare for a little bit, if you have enough time, I suggest you interview from the house The companyâ€™s
engineering blog looks at the technology stack/product of the home and makes it clear. Then we can
do all the interview questions we can find.... If you are firm
hold imagine what will happen will really see the experience, you will find a lot of places have in common, you can see more photos gourd painting
scoop ...

then there is the interview should be how to approach this Questions I talk about my practice
1. product spec / usage scenario and the interviewer confirm this thing in the end is what to do
can be the first to list a few major functionality, then you have time, add some unimportant
you think write Down

2. Define some major components
is to draw a few circle frames, each to express some of your opinions .... and then say how the interaction between them

above is the question specific thing,
this is finished, we can talk about some The questions are used, such as
how to scale / how to achieve partition / how to achieve consistency, these things can be applied to any question, of



course, the problems we encountered and the method of solving problems may be different, not necessarily every way there is a problem down the large ones,
most importantly, when to be methodical topic, drawing to clear, maintain and exchange interviewer, at any time ask the person
views the house.

There are so many things that I can think of. Welcome everyone to communicate. I hope everyone can find the ideal job.
