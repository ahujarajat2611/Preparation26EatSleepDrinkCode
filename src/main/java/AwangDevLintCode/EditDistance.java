Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2.
(each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example
Given word1 = "mart" and word2 = "karma", return 3.

Thoughts:
Draw a 2D array, consider rows as word1 and cols as word2.
DP[i][j] means the steps (edit distance) to take to transfer word1[0 ~ i] to word2[0 ~ j]
And, we have 3 different calculations for the 3 methods:
1. Replace: DP[i][j] = word1[i-1] == word2[j-1] ? DP[i - 1][j - 1] : DP[i-1][j-1] + 1;
2. Insert: DP[i][j]  = word1[i - 1][j] + 1; // missing 1 char in word1
3. Delete: DP[i][j]  = word1[i][j - 1] + 1; // extra char in word1

Note: just remember to publish from i=1,j=1, because we are using DP[i-1][j-1], becareful with border case
