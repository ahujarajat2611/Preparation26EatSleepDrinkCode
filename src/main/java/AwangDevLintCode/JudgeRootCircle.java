/*
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string.
And each move is represent by a character.
The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false
*/

/*
Thoughts:
Each letter represent a movement:
U: {0, 1}
D: {0, -1}
R: {1, 0}
L: {-1, 0}
Just add them all together O(n).

Or, even easier:
Add all of U && D; check if equal to 0.
Add all of R && L; check if equal to 0
