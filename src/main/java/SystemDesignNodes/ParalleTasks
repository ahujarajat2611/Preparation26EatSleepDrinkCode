Task Parallelization

Parallelization of tasks can be done at several levels:
Distributing separate
tasks onto separate computers.
Distributing separate
tasks onto separate CPUs on the same computer.
Distributing separate
tasks onto separate threads on the same CPU.

Executing multiple different
applications on the same computer,
 possible using the same CPU or using different CPUs is referred to as "multitasking".
Distributing tasks inside the same
application to different threads is referred to as
 "multithreading".
