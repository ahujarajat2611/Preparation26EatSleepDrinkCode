I would like to know the
internals of the tomcat NIO connector.
How exactly are threads used when we create a
servlet that implements CometProcessor?Is it still one thread per connection?

From what I read, the conversation goes like this

Client connects to a servlet
Servlet hangs on to the connection
till there is any data available
to the connected client
When data is ready ,
the server writes to the httpResponse
 and flushes it. This actually disconnects the connection?
Client sends another request
 which the server again hangs onto..
How many thread are used when this keeps happening?
