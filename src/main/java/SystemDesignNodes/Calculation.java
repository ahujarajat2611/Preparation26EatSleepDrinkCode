//    1MB
//    1 Mbps :- 1 million bits per seconds
//    10 mbps :- 10 million bits per seond
//    1 Gbps :- 1 billion bits per second

/*
//1 MB/s = 1024 KB/s = 1048576 B/s = 8 388 608 bps
//1 Mbps = 1000 Kbps = 1 000 000 bps
//100 Mbps :-

//1 Mbps means :- 1 million bits per second
// usually you will end up doing this calculation in reverse

like you canclutae bits and from there onwards calculate the the speed
using above formula !!!

1 million bits means 1 Mbps
8 million bits means 1 MBps

Computer Ethernet supports following speeds
1 Mbps
10 Mbps
1 Gb ps
means 1 billion bits per second ( 1 Gbps)
