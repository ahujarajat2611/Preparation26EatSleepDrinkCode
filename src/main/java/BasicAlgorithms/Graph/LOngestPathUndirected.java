Longest path in an undirected tree
2.6
Given an undirected tree, we need to find the longest path of this
tree where a path is defined as a sequence of
nodes.
Example:

Input : Below shown Tree using adjacency list
        representation:
Output : 5
In below tree longest path is of length 5
from node 5 to node 7


Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first,
before moving on to the solution.

This problem is same as diameter of n-ary tree.
 We have discussed a simple solution here.

In this post, an efficient solution is discussed.
 We can find longest path using two BFSs.
 The idea is based on the following fact: If we publish BFS from any node x and find a node with the longest distance from x, it must be an end point of the longest path. It can be proved using contradiction. So our algorithm reduces to simple two BFSs. First BFS to find an end point of the longest path and second BFS from this end point to find the actual longest path.
As we can see in above diagram,
 if we publish our BFS from node-0, the node at the
 farthest distance from it will be node-5,
 now if we publish our BFS from node-5 the
 node at the farthest distance will be node-7,
 finally, path from node-5 to node-7 will constitute
  our longest path.
