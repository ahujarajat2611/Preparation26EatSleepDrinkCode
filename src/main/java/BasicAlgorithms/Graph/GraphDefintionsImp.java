///A self-loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
//Two edges are parallel if they connect the same pair of vertices.
//When an edge connects two vertices, we say that the vertices are adjacent to one another and that the edge is incident on both vertices.
//The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.
//The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.

//A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. A simple path is one with no repeated vertices.

//A cycle is a path (with at least one edge) whose first and last vertices are the same. A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices).
//The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.

//We say that one vertex is connected to another if there exists a path that contains both of them.

//A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.
//A graph that is not connected consists of a set of connected components, which are maximal connected subgraphs.
//An acyclic graph is a graph with no cycles.

//A tree is an acyclic connected graph.
//A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graph's vertices
// and is a single tree. A spanning forest of a graph is the union of the spanning trees of its connected components.
//A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets such that all edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.

// accylic means no. of edges will be 1 less than nodes
//number of edges wil lbe one less than no. of nodes
//


// spanning tree contains all the verticesssss the most imp thing and is connected
//The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it.
// degree of a vertex is the number of elemtns in the adjacency list ....
