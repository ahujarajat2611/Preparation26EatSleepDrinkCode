The series of problems are typical dp. The key for dp is to find the variables to represent the states and deduce the transition function.

Of course one may come up with a O(1) space solution directly, but I think it is better to be generous when you think and be greedy when you implement.

The natural states for this problem is the 3 possible transactions : buy, sell, rest. Here rest means no transaction on that day (aka cooldown).

Then the transaction sequences can end with any of these three states.

For each of them we make an array, buy[n], sell[n] and rest[n].

buy[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with buy.

sell[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with sell.

rest[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with rest.

Then we want to deduce the transition functions for buy sell and rest. By definition we have:

buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1]-price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])
Where price is the price of day i. All of these are very straightforward. They simply represents :

(1) We have to `rest` before we `buy` and
(2) we have to `buy` before we `sell`
One tricky point is how do you make sure you sell before you buy, since from the equations it seems that [buy, rest, buy] is entirely possible.

Well, the answer lies within the fact that buy[i] <= rest[i] which means rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1]). That made sure [buy, rest, buy] is never occurred.

A further observation is that and rest[i] <= sell[i] is also true therefore

rest[i] = sell[i-1]
Substitute this in to buy[i] we now have 2 functions instead of 3:



WATTTTTTA SOLUTION
buy[i] = max(sell[i-2]-price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])

Given any day I, its max profit status boils down to one of the two status below:

(1) buy status:
buy[i] represents the max profit
at day i in buy status, given that the last actio
n you took is a buy action at day K, where K<=i. And you have the right to sell at day i+1, or do nothing.
(2) sell status:
sell[i] represents the max profit a
t day i in sell status, given that the last action you took is a sell action at day K, where K<=i. And you have the right to buy at day i+1, or do nothing.

Let's walk through from base case.

Base case:
We can publish from buy status, which means we buy stock at day 0.
buy[0]=-prices[0];
Or we can publish from sell status, which means we sell stock at day 0.
Given that we don't have any stock at hand in day 0, we set sell status to be 0.
sell[0]=0;

Status transformation:
At day i, we may buy stock (from previous sell status) or do nothing (from previous buy status):
buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 1] - prices[i]);
Or
At day i, we may sell stock (from previous buy status) or keep holding (from previous buy status):
sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i]);

Finally:
We will return sell[last_day] as our result, which represents the max profit at the last day, given that you took sell action at any day before the last day.

We can apply transaction fee at either buy status or sell status.

So here come our two solutions:

Solution I -- pay the fee when buying the stock:

public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        if (prices.length <= 1) return 0;
        int days = prices.length, buy[] = new int[days], sell[] = new int[days];
        buy[0]=-prices[0]-fee;
        for (int i = 1; i<days; i++) {
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 1] - prices[i] - fee); // keep the same as day i-1, or buy from sell status at day i-1
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i]); // keep the same as day i-1, or sell from buy status at day i-1
        }
        return sell[days - 1];
    }
Solution II -- pay the fee when selling the stock:

    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        if (prices.length <= 1) return 0;
        int days = prices.length, buy[] = new int[days], sell[] = new int[days];
        buy[0]=-prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i<days; i++) {
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 1] - prices[i]); // keep the same as day i-1, or buy from sell status at day i-1
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee); // keep the same as day i-1, or sell from buy status at day i-1
        }
        return sell[days - 1];
    }
