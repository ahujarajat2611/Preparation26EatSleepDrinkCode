/*
We say that a vertex w is reachable from a vertex v if there exists a directed path from v to w.
We say that two vertices v and w are strongly connected if they are mutually reachable: there is a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v.
A digraph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex.
A digraph that is not strongly connected consists of a set of strongly-connected components, which are maximal strongly-connected subgraphs.
A directed acyclic graph (or DAG) is a digraph with no directed cycles.
