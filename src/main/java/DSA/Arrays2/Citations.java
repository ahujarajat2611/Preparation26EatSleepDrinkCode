Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers
have at least h citations each,
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and
each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:

An easy approach is to sort the array first.
What are the possible values of h-index?
A faster approach is to use extra space.

Thoughts:O(nlogn)
	N = 5, so max of h = 5. min of h = 0.
		1. h = 5, loop through the array and count the # of citations that are >= h.
		2 .h = 4 ... h=1, h=0.
		=> O(n^2).

	If sort it : 0,1,3,5,6
		Find find index x = N - h, and arr[x] >= h
		that becomes find index x that arr[x] >=h ,where h = N - x.
			Foor loop on h, O(n)
				pick x = N - h, and check if arr[x] >= h
		h = 5, x = 5 -5 = 0. arr[x] = 0 < h. not working
		h = 4, x = 5 - 4 = 1. arr[x] = 1. no.
		h=3,x=5-3 =2,arr[x]=3  3>=3, okay.
	nLogn + N = O(nlogn)
