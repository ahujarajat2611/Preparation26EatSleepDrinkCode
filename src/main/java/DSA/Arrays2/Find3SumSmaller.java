 *         Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of
 *         index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the
 *         condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.
 * 
 *         For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.
 * 
 *         Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
 * 
 *         [-2, 0, 1] [-2, 0, 3] Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?
