 *         You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an
 *
 *         infinite amount of water supply available.
 *         You need to determine
 *         whether it is possible to measure exactly z
 *         litres using these two
 *         jugs.
 * 
 *         If z liters of water is measurable,
 *         you must have z liters of water
 *         contained within one or both buckets by the end.
 * 
 *         Operations allowed:
 * 
 *         Fill any of the jugs
 *         completely with water.
 *         Empty any of the jugs.
 *         Pour water from one jug into another
 *         till the other jug is completely
 *         full or the first jug itself is empty.
 *         Example 1: (From the famous
 *         "Die Hard" example)
 * 
 *         Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4 Output: True
 * 
 *         Example 2:
 * 
 *         Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5 Output: False
