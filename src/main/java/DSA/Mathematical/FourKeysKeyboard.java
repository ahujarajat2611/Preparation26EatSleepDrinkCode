 *         Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:
 * 
 *         Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.
 * 
 *         Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.
 * 
 *         Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.
 * 
 *         Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has
 *         already been printed.
 * 
 *         Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four
 *         keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.
 * 
 *         Example 1: Input: N = 3 Output: 3 Explanation: We can at most get 3
 *         A's on screen by pressing following key sequence: A, A, A Example 2:
 *         Input: N = 7 Output: 9 Explanation: We can at most get 9 A's on
 *         screen by pressing following key sequence: A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C,
 *         Ctrl V, Ctrl V
